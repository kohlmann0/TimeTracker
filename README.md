# TimeTracker Rev1.0
This is a time tracker widget. 
The purpose is to sit on your desktop and quickly and easily log your time to a tab delimited text file.

Enter a description of your task, or what piece of code you are working on. Select the project to apply the time to, and
press start, to start the timer running. If you need a coffee break, but don't want to stop the clock, just hit pause, and
unpause it when you get back. When you are ready to record the log to the text file, just press Stop.

You can import that time_log.txt file into an excel spreadsheet and manipulate the data more, if you desire, or you
can just use it as a reminder of what you've done during the day.
If you want to add more default projects, add them to the project_list.txt

Good luck and Good time-keeping.
